## Overview

FerrisPad is a simple, ultra-fast text editor built with Rust and FLTK. Named after **Ferris** ü¶Ä (the beloved mascot of the Rust programming language), this notepad embodies the Rust philosophy of being fast, reliable, and memory-safe.

It's designed for those who want something that just works - no bells and whistles, no feature bloat, just a clean, responsive notepad that opens instantly and gets out of your way.

This isn't meant to change the landscape of text editors. It's meant to be that reliable tool you can always count on when you need to quickly jot something down or edit a file without waiting for heavy editors to load.

> **About Ferris**: Ferris is the unofficial mascot of Rust, a friendly orange crab that represents the community values of the language: safety, speed, and concurrency. Just like Ferris helps make Rust development enjoyable, FerrisPad aims to make text editing simple and delightful.
