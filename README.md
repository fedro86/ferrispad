## Overview

FerrisPad is a simple, ultra-fast text editor built with Rust and FLTK. Named after **Ferris** ü¶Ä (the beloved mascot of the Rust programming language), this notepad embodies the Rust philosophy of being fast, reliable, and memory-safe.

It's designed for those who want something that just works - no bells and whistles, no feature bloat, just a clean, responsive notepad that opens instantly and gets out of your way.

This isn't meant to change the landscape of text editors. It's meant to be that reliable tool you can always count on when you need to quickly jot something down or edit a file without waiting for heavy editors to load.

> **About Ferris**: Ferris is the unofficial mascot of Rust, a friendly orange crab that represents the community values of the language: safety, speed, and concurrency. Just like Ferris helps make Rust development enjoyable, FerrisPad aims to make text editing simple and delightful.

## Installation

### Download Pre-Built Binaries

**Visit our website:** üëâ **[www.ferrispad.com](https://www.ferrispad.com)** üëà

Download ready-to-use binaries for:
- **Linux** - `.deb` package or standalone binary
- **macOS** - Universal binary (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- **Windows** - Portable `.zip` archive

### Quick Install (Linux/Ubuntu)

```bash
# Download and install the .deb package
wget https://www.ferrispad.com/assets/binaries/ubuntu/FerrisPad-v0.1.4-ubuntu-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i FerrisPad-v0.1.4-ubuntu-amd64.deb

# Launch from application menu or run
FerrisPad
```

### Windows Security Warning

When running FerrisPad on Windows for the first time, you may see a "Windows protected your PC" warning. This is **normal** for open source software that is not code-signed with a commercial certificate (which costs $100-400/year).

**FerrisPad is safe to run**. The source code is completely open and auditable on GitHub.

**To run FerrisPad:**
1. Click "More info" on the warning dialog
2. Click "Run anyway"

**Alternative method:**
1. Right-click the downloaded `.zip` file
2. Select "Properties"
3. Check the "Unblock" box at the bottom
4. Click "OK"
5. Extract and run normally

This warning appears for many open source projects including GIMP, Audacity, and other community-developed software. If we add paid code signing in the future, this warning will disappear.

### Build from Source

#### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)
- FLTK dependencies for your system

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libfltk1.3-dev libfontconfig1-dev libxext-dev libxft-dev \
  libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxrender-dev libxfixes-dev libpango1.0-dev \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
```

**macOS:**
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### Build Commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fedro86/ferrispad
cd ferrispad
cargo build --release
```

**Build Distribution Packages:**
```bash
# Interactive build menu for all platforms
./scripts/build-releases.sh

# Or build .deb package directly (Linux)
cargo install cargo-deb
cargo deb
```

See [BUILD_GUIDE.md](docs/guides/BUILD_GUIDE.md) for detailed build instructions

### Install Desktop Integration (Linux)

For proper icon display and application menu integration when building from source:
```bash
./scripts/install-desktop.sh
```

This will:
- Install FerrisPad icons in all standard sizes (16x16 to 512x512)
- Create desktop entry for application menu
- Register with the desktop environment
- Enable proper icon display in taskbar/dock

To uninstall:
```bash
./scripts/uninstall-desktop.sh
```

**Note**: The `.deb` package automatically handles desktop integration.

### Run
```bash
# Run from source
cargo run --release

# Or run the compiled binary
./target/release/FerrisPad

# Or launch from application menu (after installing desktop integration)
```

## Usage

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**File Operations:**
- **Ctrl+N** - New file
- **Ctrl+O** - Open file
- **Ctrl+S** - Save (quick save to existing file)
- **Ctrl+Shift+S** - Save As (save with new name/location)
- **Ctrl+Q** - Quit

**Edit Operations:**
- **Ctrl+F** - Find text
- **Ctrl+H** - Find & Replace

### Menu Options

**File Menu:**
- **Settings...** - Configure theme, font, view preferences, and auto-update behavior (saved automatically)

**Edit Menu:**
- **Find...** - Search for text with case-sensitive option
- **Replace...** - Find and replace text with Replace and Replace All

### Privacy & Updates

FerrisPad includes an optional auto-update checker that:
- Checks GitHub's public API once per 24 hours for new releases
- Can be completely disabled in **File ‚Üí Settings**
- Sends **no personal data** or telemetry
- Is fully transparent and auditable (open source)
- Notifies you with a subtle banner when updates are available
- Never downloads or installs anything automatically

The update check is privacy-first by design, following best practices from projects like VS Code, Firefox, and Notepad++.

## Building Your Own Features

FerrisPad is intentionally simple and well-structured, making it easy to extend. The codebase is clean and documented, perfect for:

- **Learning Rust GUI development** with FLTK
- **Adding your own features** (syntax highlighting, tabs, etc.)
- **Customizing the interface** to your needs
- **Understanding cross-platform desktop app architecture**

Key files:
- `src/main.rs` - Main application logic and UI
- `src/settings.rs` - Settings persistence module
- `assets/` - Application icons and resources
- `scripts/` - Build and installation scripts
- `docs/` - Website and documentation

See [BUILD_GUIDE.md](BUILD_GUIDE.md) for building distribution packages

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Rust ü¶Ä
- **GUI Framework**: FLTK (Fast Light Toolkit)
- **Image Handling**: Embedded PNG assets
- **Platform Support**: Linux, macOS, Windows

## Philosophy

FerrisPad follows the Unix philosophy: do one thing and do it well. It's not trying to be VSCode or Vim or Emacs. It's just a notepad that:

- Starts instantly
- Handles text editing reliably
- Stays out of your way
- Provides a solid foundation for customization

## Troubleshooting

### Icons Not Showing
If the crab icon doesn't appear in your taskbar or application menu:

1. **Run the installation script**:
   ```bash
   ./install-desktop.sh
   ```

2. **Clear icon cache**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.cache/icon-theme.cache
   gtk-update-icon-cache -f -t ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/
   ```

3. **Restart your desktop environment** or log out and log back in

4. **Check if icons were installed**:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/ferrispad.png
   ```

### Application Not in Menu
If FerrisPad doesn't appear in your application menu:
```bash
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```
